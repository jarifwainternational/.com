        <h2>Become a Jarifwa Teacher</h2>
        <p>When you become a JARIFWA teacher you get more than the opportunity to teach in the United States, Australia, and China. You get free services and individual support from JARIFWA staff. We are with you every step of the way to make sure you are comfortable in your classroom, you have the opportunity to meet other JARIFWA teachers near you, and you — and your family — have a fulfilling international experience.</p>

        <h2>Find a JARIFWA Teacher</h2>
        <p>Our teachers help fill teacher shortages in the USA, Australia, and China while providing a rich, cultural exchange that will help your students see the world in a different light. When you work with us, you can be sure you’re getting an experienced and qualified educator. That’s because our staff carefully screens applicants before they’re accepted and gives them the support they need once they’re here.</p>
